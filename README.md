# समवाय: Negotiation Engine

## Overview
This project comprises several notebooks aimed at different aspects of a negotiation application. The main notebooks are:

1. **Negotiation_Flask_API_VT(1)**:
    - This notebook serves as the main implementation for the Flask API used in the negotiation application.

2. **Negotiation_Similarity**:
    - This notebook is utilized for training and testing similarity scores, which are crucial for the negotiation process.

3. **Negotiation_Engine**:
    - The main notebook where the Language Model (LLM) has been fine-tuned specifically for the negotiation task. This notebook plays a central role in orchestrating the negotiation process.

## Notebooks Overview
- **Negotiation_Flask_API_VT(1)**:
    - Contains the codebase for the Flask API, providing endpoints for various functionalities within the negotiation application.

- **Negotiation_Similarity**:
    - Focuses on training and testing similarity scores, a key component for determining negotiation strategies and outcomes.

- **Negotiation_Engine**:
    - Centralizes the fine-tuning of the Language Model (LLM) tailored specifically for negotiations. It's the core component responsible for driving the negotiation process.

## Usage
- **Negotiation_Flask_API_VT(1)**:
    - This notebook serves as a guide to set up and run the Flask API for the negotiation application.

- **Negotiation_Similarity**:
    - Utilized for training and evaluating similarity scores, crucial for determining negotiation strategies and outcomes.

- **Negotiation_Engine**:
    - Contains the fine-tuning process of the Language Model (LLM) for negotiation tasks, pivotal for the negotiation process's success.

### Steps to Run the Jupyter Notebook

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: If you haven't already installed Jupyter Notebook, you can install it via pip:
    ```
    pip install notebook
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Jupyter Notebook file to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change directory to the location where you cloned the repository:
    ```
    cd your-repository
    ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook**: Launch the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. **Open the Notebook**: Once the server starts, your default web browser should open automatically. If not, you can visit `http://localhost:8888` in your browser. Navigate to the directory where the notebook is located and click on the notebook file to open it.

6. **Run the Notebook Cells**: Once the notebook is open, you can run the cells one by one by pressing `Shift + Enter`. Make sure to run the cells in sequential order to ensure proper execution.

7. **Interact with the Notebook**: You can interact with the notebook by editing and running cells as needed. Follow the instructions within the notebook to proceed with your analysis, experiment, or any other tasks.

8. **Save Your Work**: Remember to save your work periodically by clicking on the "Save" button or by pressing `Ctrl + S`.
